## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal

By the time this project is complete, it will be a fully featured mobile application that:

- **Seamlessly connects** to any vehicleâ€™s OBDâ€‘II port (via Bluetooth or Wiâ€‘Fi) to ingest realâ€‘time engine and driving telemetry.
- **Continuously evaluates** key driving metrics (e.g., harsh acceleration, sudden braking, cornering, speed compliance) and computes an easyâ€‘toâ€‘understand safety score for each trip.
- **Delivers actionable insights** through interactive visualizationsâ€”heatmaps of problem areas, trip summaries, and trend chartsâ€”so drivers (or parents of teen drivers) can pinpoint and correct risky behaviors.
- **Provides a parental dashboard** that:
  - Highlights repeat problem zones on a map
  - Sends customizable alerts for outâ€‘ofâ€‘bounds driving events
  - Tracks a teenâ€™s progress over time with historical score comparisons
- **Supports an insurance preview mode** (optional)â€”letting individuals simulate how their driving score would translate into usageâ€‘based rates, before investing in a full telematics policy.
- **Is designed for extensibility**, so future enhancements (gamification, social leaderboards, automated coaching prompts, etc.) can be added with minimal friction.

With these features, the finished product will empower parents to coach their teens and help all drivers develop safer habits.
